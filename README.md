# MineSweeper-in-C
This is my first C project and I did it for my C programming course at McMaster University. The game play is very similar to the original Minesweeper gameplay, the only difference is in the way of interacting with the game. This game runs on a command line interface and requires text inputs by the user. 

If you wish to play, download the main.c file along with the Makefile and store them both in the same directory. Once this is done, open the terminal (or command prompt for windows) and type "make". This will create an executable named "main" in the same directory. You can run the game using the comman "./main". You can also run the game without the makefile by downloading the main.c code and following the compilation instructions. 

The biggest challenge was ensuring that the game is able to handle all types of user inputs and react accordingly.
